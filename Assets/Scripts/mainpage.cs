/** \mainpage
 * 
 * This open-source pneumatic simulator is a work in progress being developed by me, Gabriel Naves, as 
 * my final undergraduate assignment. It is intended to be used as a tool for teaching pneumatic systems
 * in the [University of Brasília](http://www.unb.br/).
 * 
 * ## Check out the Latest version! 
 * 
 * The latest version of the simulator can always be found on [my website](http://gabrielnaves.com/simulator/index.html),
 * but you can also download the latest version (for windows) from the project's
 * [github repository](https://github.com/gabrielnaves/TG/releases).
 * 
 * ## Development
 * 
 * The simulator is being developed in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). The game engine was chosen due to
 * the possibility of building for [many different platforms](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/multiplatform).
 * Unity allows scripting in C# and Javascript, and the language chosen for this project is C#.
